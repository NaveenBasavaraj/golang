# Go Lang

## Why Golang?

1. Execution Speed: Go is much faster than Js, Python, Ruby, PhP
2. Compilation Speed: Go is much faster than Rust, C, C++, Java, C#


Go lang is not an interpreted language like python
Its a compiled language --> uses go compiler to --> produce machine code

main.go -> compilation to binary --> go build --> hello world.exe

Go is strongly typed language
